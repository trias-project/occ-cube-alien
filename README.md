# Occurrence processing

## Rationale

This repository contains the functionality to process occurrence data and create aggregated **occurrence data cubes**. An occurrence data cube is a multi-dimensional array of values. In our context we have three dimensions, ``N = 3``:

1. taxonomic (taxon)
2. temporal (year)
3. spatial (cell code)

For each triplet the stored value represent the number of occurrences found in [GBIF](www.gbif.org/occurrence).

As the data cubes are used as input for modelling and risk assessment, we store the smallest geographic coordinate uncertainty of the occurrences assigned to a certain cell code as value as well. The occurrences are first reassigned randomly within their uncertainty circle before assigning them to a cell. If uncertainty is not available, a default 1000m radius is assigned. Due, to the random assignment, the same occurrence data could result in different data cubes if iterated. This aspect will be soon subject of study [here](https://github.com/trias-project/aoo-paper).

Using a tabular structure (typical of R data.frames), a cube would look like this:

taxon | year | cell code | number of occurrences | minimal coordinate uncertainty
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2366634 | 2002 | 1kmE3872N3101 | 8 | 250
2382155 | 2002 | 1kmE3872N3101 | 3 | 250
2498252 | 2002 | 1kmE3872N3149 | 2 | 1000
5232437 | 2002 | 1kmE3872N3149 | 4 | 1000

where number of columns is equal to number of dimensions, ``N``, plus number of values. In our case we have three dimensions and two values.

### Occurrence data cube of alien species in Belgium

One of the main output of TrIAS project is delivering a global, unified checklist of alien species in Belgium. This checklist is published on GBIF as [_Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - Belgium_](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/6d9e952f-948c-4483-9807-575348147c7e). More information can be found [here](https://trias-project.github.io/unified-checklist/). In this repository we produce an occurrence data cube of all taxa of the unified checklist that have at least one occurrence in Belgium. As it is impossible to retrieve occurrences of thousands of taxa from GBIF at once (query is limited to 12000 characters), we harvested ALL occurrences in Belgium. This first step is documented in [/src/belgium/download.Rmd](). At the moment of writing, the GBIF download counts almost 20 million occurrences. In order to handling such huge amount of data, we decided to work using a [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) file, see second step: [/src/belgium/create_db.Rmd](). Handling occurrence geographic uncertainty and assigning the correspondent cell codes to occurrences is the third step, documented in [/src/belgium/assign_grid.Rmd](). Finally, we select the alien species belonging to the [_Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species - Belgium_](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/6d9e952f-948c-4483-9807-575348147c7e) and aggregate the occurrences by year, cell code and taxon as described in the fourth and last pipeline: [/src/belgium/aggregate.Rmd](). The resulting occurrence data cube is saved in file [`/data/output/cube_belgium.tsv`](). We also produce a data cube at kingdom level: [`/data/belgium/cube_baseline.tsv`](). which can be used as baseline to tackle the research bias effort while calculating occurrence-based indicators.

### Occurrence data cube of selected modelling species in Europe

The TrIAS project aims to assess risk of invasion by applying distribution modelling and other modelling techniques for a subset of taxa of the unified checklist. The list is saved in file [`/data/reference/modelling_species.tsv`](). For these species we build a specific occurrence data cube which takes into account all occurrences in Europe. The region we define as Europe is described by the European Environmental Agency, see image [here](https://github.com/trias-project/occ-processing/blob/master/references/Europe.png). Similarly to the _Belgian cube_, we first download the occurrences of these species following the workflow described in [`src/europe/download.Rmd`](). Then, we assign the occurrences randomly within their uncertainty circles in order to calculate the 1kmx1km cell they belong to, see [`/src/europe/assign_grid.Rmd`]() and finally we aggregate as described in [/src/europe/aggregate.Rmd]() in order to produce the final occurrence data cube at European level.

### Occurrences of accepeted taxa, synonyms or infraspecific taxa

If a taxon has taxonomic status `ACCEPTED`  or  `DOUBTFUL`, i.e. it's not a synonym, then GBIF returns not only the occurrences linked directly to it, but also the occurrences linked to its synonyms and its infraspecific taxa.

As example, consider the species [_Reynoutria japonica Houtt._`](https://www.gbif.org/species/2889173). If you search for its occurrrences wordwide you will get all the occurrences from the synonyms and infraspecies too.

By aggregating we would loose this information, so we provide aside the cubes, `occ_cube.tsv` and `occ_europe.tsv`, a kind of taxonomic compendium, `occ_belgium_taxa.tsv` and `occ_europe_taxa.tsv` respectively. They include for each taxa in the cube all the synonyms or infraspecies whose occurrences contribute to the total count.

For example, _Aedes japonicus (Theobald, 1901)_ is an accepted species present in the belgian cube: based on the information stored in `occ_belgium_taxa.tsv`, its occurrences include occurrences linked to the following taxa:
1. [Aedes japonicus (Theobald, 1901)](https://www.gbif.org/species/1652212)
2. [Ochlerotatus japonicus (Theobald, 1901)](https://www.gbif.org/species/4519733)
3. [Aedes japonicus subsp. japonicus](https://www.gbif.org/species/7346173)

## Installation

Clone this repository to your computer and open the RStudio project file,  `occ-processing.Rproj`.

### Generate occurrence data cube for Belgium

You can generate the Belgian occurrence data cube by running the [R Markdown files](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) in `src/belgium` following the order shown here below:

1. `download.Rmd`: trigger a GBIF download and add it to the list of triggered downloads
2. `create_db.Rmd`: create a sqlite database and perform basic data cleaning
3. `assign_grid.Rmd`: assign geographic cell code to occurrence data
4. `aggregate.Rmd`: aggregate occurrences per taxon, year and cell code, the _Belgian occurrence data cube_

In the aggregation step, we also create a data cube at kingdom level. The data subes are authomatically generated in  folder `/data/output/`.

### Generate occurrence data cube for Europe

At European level we are interested in occurrences of a list of taxa, which will be used for modelling and risk assessment. This list is maintained in file `modelling_species.tsv` in folder `references`. 

You can generate the European occurrence data cube by running the [R Markdown files](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) in `src/europe` following the order shown here below:

1. `download.Rmd`: trigger a GBIF download and adding it to the list of triggered downloads
3. `assign_grid.Rmd`: assign geographic cell code to occurrence data
4. `aggregate.Rmd`: aggregate occurrences per taxa, year and cell code, the European _occurrence data cube_.
